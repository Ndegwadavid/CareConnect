# Healthcare Patient Administration System

This project is designed to simplify healthcare patient administration by providing a centralized system for managing patient information. With this system, healthcare providers can easily access and update patient records, view medical histories, and schedule appointments. The system also includes features for tracking medications, managing insurance information, and generating reports. By streamlining these administrative tasks, healthcare providers can focus more on providing quality care to their patients both remotely and on premise.

## Getting Started

To use this system, you will need to have access to a web server running MySQL. You can install these components on your local machine using a tool like XAMPP or WAMP, or you can use a cloud-based hosting service like AWS or DigitalOcean.

Once you have your web server set up, simply clone this repository to your server's web directory and import the included SQL file to create the necessary database tables.

## Usage

To use the system, simply navigate to the admin panel path in your web browser. From there, you will be prompted to log in with your admin credentials. Once logged in, you will have access to the following features:

- View patient records
- Add new patients
- Update patient information
- Schedule appointments
- Track medications
- Manage insurance information
- Generate reports
